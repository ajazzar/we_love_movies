# We_Love_Movies project

In this Web Development project, I set up a database and built specific routes so that 
users can gain access to data about movies, theaters, and reviews.

## Project Tasks

- Install and use common middleware packages

- Receive requests through routes

- Run tests from the command line

- Access relevant information through route and query parameters

- Create an error handler for the case where a route doesn't exist

- Build an API following RESTful design principles

- Create and customize a knexfile.js file

- Create a connection to the database with Knex

- Write database queries to complete CRUD routes in an Express server

- Return joined and nested data with Knex

- Write database migrations using Knex's migration tool

- Deploy your backend server to a cloud service
